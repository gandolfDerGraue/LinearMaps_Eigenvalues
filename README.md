# LinearMaps_Eigenvalues

the grid shows the linear map, which is represented by the matrix

hover mouse over matrix entries, type a number to edit entry
click on entry to make it negative

first button active-> move mouse left to right to animate the linear map

for finding the eigenvalues, we must find the value t for which the determinant of (matrix A - t * Identity Matrix) =0
-> t is eigenvalue of A
second button active-> move mouse left to right to set the t value, to find determinant = 0
